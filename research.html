	<h3>research</h3>
	<h4>postdoc</h4>
	
	IceCube and P-ONE experiments, MSU. 
	
	I am a post-doctoral researcher at MSU in East Lansing.

	<h5> Hardware </h5>

	I run the Northern Testing System (NTS) used for the IceCube upgrade. This facility that tests communication systems before South Pole deployment of upgrade materials from cables to firmware. I also assist and overview the upgrade mDOM modules at MSU and their Final Acceptance Testing (FAT). I supervise five undergraduates who work daily in the laboratory. 

	<h5> Software </h5>

	I am the designer of the on-shore P-ONE trigger software. This software will be used for first string deployment in Winter 2025.
	I am also involved in the software reconstruction of long-lived particles decaying to leptons in the IceCube experiment. 

	<h5> Analyses </h5>

	<p>The theoretical particles that I look for are called "long-lived" particles (or LLPs, for short). I am one of three contributing analysis members for the search for LLPs in IceCube. These LLPs are produced via neutrino interaction in the upper ice, have a "track gap", and decay back into SM leptons that are visible to our detector. The signature we look for is the "track gap", thus the name "Track Gap Analysis". </p>
	<p>The second analysis I am underway in designing is the Double Pulse analysis in IceCube. This searches in the 10+ years of data module pulse signatures that have two distinct peaks. These peaks in the pulses are due to secondary leptonic decays from taus. Taus are rarely produced in IceCube, and they also decay mostly hadronically. These two aspects make tau signatures very difficult to capture. It is then imperative reconstruction tools and analyses are designed with high precision to find these hidden Double Pulses in our data. The commencement of this project is projected to be in September 2024. </p>
	


	<h4>phd</h4>
	<p>The theoretical particles that I look for are called "long-lived" particles (or LLPs, for short). 

	These are particles that decay far out in the ATLAS detector into standard model particles, thus producing a unique signature of that standard model particle. 

	I look particularly at displaced tau objects in ATLAS, and my ATLAS authorship was on developing model-independent displaced tau triggers (quite a tricky challenge). <p>
